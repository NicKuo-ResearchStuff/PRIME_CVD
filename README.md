# PRIME_CVD
PRIME-CVD is a privacy-preserving, DAG-driven simulated cardiovascular dataset built for teaching medical informatics and risk modelling. It includes a clean cohort and a messy EMR-style relational transform, enabling hands-on training in causal reasoning, data cleaning, linkage, and survival analysis without real patient data.
